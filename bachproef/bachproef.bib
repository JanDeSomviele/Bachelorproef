  abstract = {Effective knowledge sharing within the R&D department is important to build and benefit from a 
company's portfolio of technologies. This paper presents challenges with accessing and sharing 
knowledge during pre-development, and elaborates on the potential of using a wiki and checklists as 
supporting tools. A wiki demonstrator for collecting knowledge about technologies was developed and 
received very positive response from the interviewees at a case company. 
The study was conducted as part of a research project about how a technology platform framework can 
increase the leverage of technology development efforts through increased reuse and strategic 
investments. The framework is intended to be used as a basis for technology development and when 
designing and configuring new products. New challenges arise for technology platforms compared to 
traditional product platforms as they support reuse on a higher abstraction level.},

  title    = {Internal Digital Platforms and Generative Mechanisms of Digital Innovation},
  doi      = {ng},
  abstract = {As digitalization puts increasing competitive pressures on companies to innovate in the 
digital space, corporate information system (IS) landscapes are increasingly serving as 
platforms that facilitate the development of digital value propositions on top of existing 
data and functionality. Beyond the boundaries of a single firm, the enabling role of multi-
sided digital platforms for innovation is a well-researched phenomenon. Internal digital 
platforms, on the other hand, have received less attention in the IS community. Their part 
in the quest for digital innovation remains unclear. In a critical realist research 
approach, this paper investigates the digitalization journey of the LEGO Group and 
identifies three generative mechanisms – modular upgradability, economies of 
substitution, and reproduction –, through which an internal digital platform enables 
speed and efficiency of digital innovation within a company. Based on Systems Theory, a 
holistic conceptualization of an internal digital platform is developed that unifies 
traditional enterprise systems with modern digital technologies. Consequently, the 
analysis elaborates how the interactions among these heterogeneous components shape 
digital innovation in a company and develops the generative mechanisms that together 
form a system-theoretic model. Furthermore, the findings reveal the strategic choice of 
granularity that companies are facing during design of individual platform components. 
Therefore, the study does not only contribute to IS theory, but also provides relevant 
implications for practitioners.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the success of digital-native companies such as Google or Salesforce, established companies such as car manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, or banks strive for value co-creation via open IT platforms. However, literature on value co-creation does not cater to the specific situation of established companies. Addressing this gap, we seek to improve our understanding of how established companies can co-create value through openness and collaboration with IT platforms. Based on an exploratory field study of a European bank that is introducing an IT platform, we show that openness and collaboration enable value co-creation while creating areas of conflict and potential benefit. For example, openness creates internal resistance and exposes technology while facilitating internal transparency and standardization. Collaboration entails conflicts with existing partners that are affected by the value co-creation strategy, but existing partners are also assets in incentivizing collaboration with third-party developers. Contributing to literature on value cocreation and openness of IT, we confirm that established companies can benefit from IT platforms but need to address specific areas of conflict and potential benefits related to balancing openness and control and governing collaboration. Our discussion provides first insights for established companies that consider implementing an IT platform strategy.},

In line with the changes in business environments based on digital platforms' ecosystem, they put forth efforts into strengthening corporate platforms. Accordingly, the study aims to clarify the effects of SMEs' digital transformation competencies on platform empowerment with platform development strategy and envelopment strategy as mediating factors. Notably, among the four platform factors that enterprises require, namely, unique competency strengthening, shared value creation, cost-saving effect, and network effect, this study analyzes which factors are more significantly affected by digital transformation competencies and platform strategies. To this end, study hypotheses were tested based on the survey conducted among 361 SME executives and employees in South Korea. In conclusion, it turned out that SMEs' digital transformation competencies positively affected both platform development strategy and envelopment strategy. However, platform envelopment strategy affected all of the factors of platform empowerment, while development strategy did not affect them. Thus, it was verified that SMEs' digital transformation competencies could affect platform empowerment through envelopment strategy more than platform development strategy.},
